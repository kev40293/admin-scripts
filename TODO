put the db query operations in separate module
db->do db->prepare, etc

initialize db from passwd - working at a basic level

write the actual table schemas - work in progress

user insert (database) - working

user remove (database) - working

scan for activity and update database - postponed, possibly unecessary

add to group

remove from group

wrap all funcionality into a console/cli application

ie landlord do
or llconsole  read commands and execute
